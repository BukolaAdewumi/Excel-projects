# Bike Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

The bike sales analysis project will focus on three key aspects: average income per purchase, customer age bracket, and customer commute. Analyzing average income per purchase will provide insights into customer spending patterns, enabling better understanding of affordability and purchasing power. Understanding customer age bracket will help identify the most interested age groups in purchasing bikes, enabling better marketing strategies and product offerings. Understanding commute patterns will identify potential product improvements or additional offerings.
